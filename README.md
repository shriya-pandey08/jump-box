This basic implementation covers:

Drawing the BOX: The box is represented as a yellow rectangle.
Gravity and Flapping: The bird falls due to gravity and moves up when you click.
Pipes: Pipes are randomly generated and move to the left.
Collision Detection: Checks for collisions between the box and the pipes.
Game Over and Reset: Alerts the player and resets the game on collision.
